## IMDB Movie Analysis
In this project, the movies in the International Movies Database (IMDB) are analyzed from 1960 to 2015. The movies are analyzed based on the casts, movie genre, budget and revenue etc. 
Three major research questions are analyzed here:

+ Who are the most featured casts and what are the characteristics attributed to them?
+ Who are the casts of the highest grossign movies and what is the general overview of their footprint in the movie industry?
+ Does genre popularity influence movie rating?

A dashboard was created from the data used for this analysis and can be accessed [here]()
