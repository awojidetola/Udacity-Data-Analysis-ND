# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree
This repository covers all the projects done in the ALXT Udacity Nanodegree program. 

## IMDB Movie Analysis
In this project, the movies in the International Movies Database (IMDB) are analyzed from 1960 to 2015. The movies are analyzed based on the casts, movie genre, budget and revenue etc. 
Three major research questions are analyzed here:

+ Who are the most featured casts and what are the characteristics attributed to them?
+ Who are the casts of the highest grossign movies and what is the general overview of their footprint in the movie industry?
+ Does genre popularity influence movie rating?

## We Rate Dogs Analysis
In this project, the @dog_rates (We Rate Dogs) twitter archive is explored and analyzed. For analysis, three major data sources are used:
+ The Enhanced Twitter Archive provided in CSV format
+ The Image Prediction dataset used to predict dog breeds
+ Data collected from Twitter using Tweepy API

The data was accessed for Quality and Tidiness issues and was cleaned for the same. The three datasets were combined into one master dataset. 

Some of the research questions analyzed are:
+ What is the most popular source of tweets?
+ Which dog stage is the most popular
+ What are the top 10 most popular dog breeds predicted by the Neural Network
+ For a given dog picture/post, what is the correlation between number of likes and number of retweets.
+
