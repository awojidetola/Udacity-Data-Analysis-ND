# PISA 2012

The Program for International Students' Assesment, also known as PISA is a survey for students to test their skilss and knowledge as they approach the end of their education.

The survey has 2 main aims and  they are : 

+	Examine how well students have learned the school curriculum
+	How prepared students are for life beyond school.

## 

The dataset used for this analysis can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisa2012.csv.zip).

+ The data used was obtained from the PISA 2012 Assesment and contains the responses of over 500,000 students (15-year olds).
+ The survey spread across 65 countries. 
+ Students from all countries were tested on their competencies in Reading, Mathematics and Science

The countries that participated in the survey/test can be found [here](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/pisa-2012-participants.htm)

## Summary of Findings
The analysis in this project focuses on the performance of students and factors influencing thier performance/behaviours in school. The breakdown of the analysis is divided into 3 main parts: 

+ Part 1 : Truancy
Truancy is a common phenomenon maongs school students. In this cases, truancy involves lateness to school, skipping some hours of school or total absence from school.Based on the result from the analysis, it was shown that the status of parents' could influence how truant their chilren are. 
Also, on average, males are truant than their female counterparts. The analysis also showed that Truancy has a negative influence on students' grades. 

+ Part 2: Performance
The performance of students in the PISA tests (on Reading, Math and Science) was analyzed. Based on the visuals provided, there was a strong positive relationship between score in Math and Scores in Science, hence students who scored well in math and a high chance of also doing well in science. 
The reading scores of students were also accessed based on their possesion of some books (literature and poetry specifically). The analysis also showed that China (Shanghai) was the top performing country in Reading, Mathematics and Science. 

## Key Insights for Presentation
For the first part, the effect of the following on Truancy was analyzed: 
+ Educational and Job Status of Parents
+ Gender of Student

Also, the effect of Truancy was tested on student performance (Grades). 

The second part focused on the performance of students in the PISA survey test. The performance was based on 3 subjects: Math, Science and Reading and the following questions were answered: 

+ Is there a relationship between the Math and Science scores of students?
+ Are there differences in reading scores based on some possesions?
+ Which countries are the top performers in the PISA 2012
